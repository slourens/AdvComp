\section{External Graphics}
Just like in LaTeX, it is pretty simple to insert external graphics into our reports. Most of the time, the graphics we want to insert into our reports are generated by R, so we can easily embed them using methods I showed in 1-example.Rmd. Sometimes, there may be a flowchart, consort diagram, or other visualization that is generated external from R. In that case, we can embed it as follows. 

## Embed online images

## That sure is small and unsatisfying. Changing the size of an online image depends on the RMarkdown parser, so I downloaded the image from the internet, placed it in the same directory (folder) as my RMarkdown document, and then was easily able to use LaTeX to embed a larger version of the image.

## Better, but blurry. We cannot fix that as it is a well-known problem with jpg, png, and other pixel-based graphics. When a photo based on raster (or pixel graphics) is ``blown up", the individual pixels take up more and more room, eventually making the image blurry since each pixel is just one color. One solution would be to use scalable vector graphics (SVGs) for images, but we won't talk about this now.

## Notice that when the output type specified in the document header is pdf_document, we can directly embed LaTeX code, so everything you learned in LaTeX should apply to RMarkdown!!

## If you are using html_document as the output type, you will need to have some working knowledge of HTML, and potentially CSS. I recommend you use PDF in this class. In summary, keep it simple.
